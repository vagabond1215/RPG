City Rest Icon Prompt (Port District Palette — Borderless, Scroll Label)

**Canvas & Style**
Square canvas, 1024 × 1024 px, transparent background.
No outer frame or drop shadow—icon floats freely.
Cute‑elegant fantasy RPG aesthetic consistent with Wave’s Break location icons: crisp line art, subtle gradients, gentle highlights.

**Scroll Banner**
Parchment scroll banner anchored along the bottom (approx. 700 × 160 px), softly curled ends, light tan base (#d7ccc8) with sandy lowlights (#c5a880).
“Rest” in bold rune‑styled serif, deep harbor blue fill (#0d47a1) with thin charcoal outline (#2f2f2f) and a faint inner glow in warm gold (#ffb300).

**Central Motif**
Secluded woodland clearing edged with low dune grass and riverstone outcrops, framing the scene without enclosing the silhouette.
A compact campfire of driftwood logs sits at center, flames rendered in layered lantern gold and coral hues with a suspended brass kettle heating over a simple tripod.
To the left, a weathered pine log and a chopped stump form rustic seating, each draped with a folded sea‑teal cloak and deep navy canteen to suggest prepared travelers.
On the right, a rolled-out bedroll-and-mat setup rests atop woven reed groundcloth: thick canvas mat, parchment-cream pillow, and a folded cloak serving as a blanket.
A travel pack leans against a nearby rock with a hanging charm of gull feathers and seashells; a pair of resting boots and a sheathed knife lie neatly beside the mat to imply readiness.
Keep background details minimal—only faint silhouettes of distant pines and firefly motes—to preserve the icon’s open silhouette.

**Color Palette**
Ground & Foliage: Mossy meadow greens (#8fae72 → #5f7a4f) blended with sandy undertones (#b7956d) and charcoal shadows (#424242); riverstones in cool slate gray (#8b8f95 → #5f6569) with pearl highlights (#f5f5f5).
Campfire & Glow: Firewood in honey oak to weathered chestnut gradient (#b68653 → #7a5031); flames layered in lantern gold (#ffb300), coral blush (#f2b8a0), and warm amber (#d98b4c) with subtle aqua sparks (#6fa5b4).
Gear & Seating: Log seats in rich chestnut wood with visible rings; cloaks and canteen straps in sea‑teal (#00838f) and deep navy (#0d47a1); bedroll canvas in parchment cream (#f5e6c5) with pearl-white highlights.
Accessories: Brass kettle, tripod fittings, and knife guard in polished brass (#d4a552 → #9c6b2f); travel pack in muted sepia leather (#5c4033) with sea‑teal stitching; feathers in pearl-white with lantern gold tips.
Atmospheric Accents: Firefly motes and ember trails rendered in soft pearl-white (#f5f5f5) with restrained lantern gold glints to keep the mood tranquil.

**Line & Texture**
Clean, moderately thin outlines in deep charcoal (#2f2f2f).
Subtle bark texture on logs, woven patterns on reed groundcloth, and crosshatched canvas folds on the bedroll.
Fire glow and ember trails use translucent gradients and tiny sparkle highlights; metallic surfaces receive restrained gleams.
Maintain empty transparency beyond the icon silhouette.
