City Explore Icon Prompt (Port District Palette — Borderless, Scroll Label)

**Canvas & Style**  
Square canvas, 1024 × 1024 px, transparent background.  
No outer frame or drop shadow—icon floats freely.  
Cute‑elegant fantasy RPG aesthetic consistent with Wave’s Break location icons: crisp line art, subtle gradients, gentle highlights.

**Scroll Banner**  
Parchment scroll banner anchored along the bottom (approx. 700 × 160 px), softly curled ends, light tan base (#d7ccc8) with sandy lowlights (#c5a880).  
“Explore” in bold rune‑styled serif, deep harbor blue fill (#0d47a1) with thin charcoal outline (#2f2f2f) and a faint inner glow in warm gold (#ffb300).

**Central Motif**  
Circular compass rose inset into a polished stone plinth, tilted slightly forward for visibility.  
Compass body features alternating honey oak and weathered chestnut segments (#b68653 → #7a5031) with pearl edge glints (#f5f5f5); directional tips outlined in deep charcoal (#2f2f2f).  
A delicate brass armillary ring arcs around the compass, accented with a hanging sea‑teal pennant (#00838f) and deep navy bead (#0d47a1) near the north point.  
Magnifying glass leaning against the plinth on the right, glass rim in charcoal metal with subtle sparkle highlights and lens catching warm lantern gold reflections.  
Map scroll partially unfurled on the left, parchment ivory (#f5e6c5) with sea‑teal routes, dotted navy landmarks, and an “X” in warm gold—ensure edges curl and overlap for depth.  
Subtle cobblestone texture beneath the plinth with two small embedded wayfinding arrows pointing outward; keep surrounding background empty.

**Color Palette**  
Compass & Plinth: Wood and stone gradient (#b68653 → #7a5031) with charcoal shadows (#424242) and pearl highlights (#f5f5f5).  
Metal Accents: Deep charcoal (#2f2f2f) with selective lantern gold glints (#ffb300).  
Map Elements: Parchment creams and warm ivories (#f5e6c5, #e8d7aa) with sea‑teal and deep navy ink strokes (#00838f, #0d47a1).  
Accessory Details: Warm sepia leather wrap on magnifying handle (#5c4033) and subtle amber glass glow.  
Port District Accents: Maintain touches of deep navy (#0d47a1), sea‑teal (#00838f), and warm lantern gold (#ffb300) for cohesive palette.

**Line & Texture**  
Clean, moderately thin outlines in deep charcoal (#2f2f2f).  
Subtle wood grain and engraved marks on compass segments; faint etched rings on the armillary and compass face markings.  
Map scroll displays gentle paper fibers and soft shading under folds; magnifying lens uses transparent gradients with a slight highlight streak.  
Reserve tiny sparkle highlights for metal rivets, compass points, and the magnifying rim; keep the negative space clear beyond the icon silhouette.
