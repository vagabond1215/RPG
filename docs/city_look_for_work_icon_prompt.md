City Look For Work Icon Prompt (Port District Palette — Borderless, Scroll Label)

**Canvas & Style**
Square canvas, 1024 × 1024 px, transparent background.
No outer frame or drop shadow—icon floats freely.
Cute‑elegant fantasy RPG aesthetic consistent with Wave’s Break location icons: crisp line art, subtle gradients, gentle highlights.

**Scroll Banner**
Parchment scroll banner anchored along the bottom (approx. 700 × 160 px), softly curled ends, light tan base (#d7ccc8) with sandy lowlights (#c5a880).
“Look For Work” in bold rune‑styled serif, deep harbor blue fill (#0d47a1) with thin charcoal outline (#2f2f2f) and a faint inner glow in warm gold (#ffb300).

**Central Motif**
Compact hiring pavilion composed of a waist‑high stone counter with a curved honey oak canopy supported by twin posts.
Behind the counter, a parchment job ledger stands open on a brass stand, pages filled with neat deep sepia entries and a few sea‑teal ribbons marking urgent postings.
Foreground features a polished brass bell with a pearl highlight and a small stack of folded application forms secured by a warm gold wax seal.
To the side, hang a trio of dangling job tags—mini parchment cards clipped to a cord—with varied corner curls and tiny navy symbols indicating trade, craft, and service roles.
Soft cobblestone base with subtle directional arrows etched toward the counter; keep distant city silhouettes minimal and misty so the scene remains icon-like.

**Color Palette**
Counter & Canopy: Honey oak to weathered chestnut wood gradient (#b68653 → #7a5031) with pearl edge glints (#f5f5f5); stone counter base in misty sandstone (#d0c4ad → #a49580) with charcoal shadows (#424242).
Ledger & Forms: Parchment creams and warm ivories (#f5e6c5, #e8d7aa) with deep sepia ink strokes (#4a3a24); ribbon markers and job tag icons in sea‑teal (#00838f) and deep navy (#0d47a1).
Metal Accents: Brass bell and stand in polished gradient (#d4a552 → #9c6b2f) with selective lantern gold highlights (#ffb300).
Cobblestones: Muted harbor gray-beige tones (#b0a999 → #8b8374) with soft charcoal seams.
Port District Touches: Maintain warm lantern gold (#ffb300) sparingly on seals, bell glow, and canopy trim to tie into the palette.

**Line & Texture**
Clean, moderately thin outlines in deep charcoal (#2f2f2f).
Subtle wood grain on canopy and posts, gentle parchment fiber details on ledger pages and job tags, and lightly engraved stone texture on the counter base.
Add faint crease marks on folded forms and restrained sparkle highlights on metal elements like the bell and brass stand.
Keep surrounding background empty beyond the icon silhouette to maintain borderless presentation.
