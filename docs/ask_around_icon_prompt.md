Ask Around Icon Prompt (Generic Fantasy — Borderless, Scroll Label)

**Canvas & Style**
Square canvas, 1024 × 1024 px, transparent background.
No outer frame or drop shadow—icon floats freely.
Welcoming high-fantasy RPG aesthetic with crisp line art, soft gradients, and lantern-lit warmth; avoid regional motifs so it fits any setting.

**Scroll Banner**
Parchment scroll banner anchored along the bottom (approx. 700 × 160 px), softly curled ends, light tan base (#d7ccc8) with gentle parchment lowlights (#c5a880).
“Ask Around” in bold rune-styled serif, deep midnight blue fill (#1a2b6d) with thin charcoal outline (#2f2f2f) and a faint inner glow in mellow gold (#e4b74f).

**Central Motif**
Circular conversation nook composed of a small round table and two inviting chairs angled toward one another, suggesting friendly discourse.
Table surface hosts a neatly stacked pair of parchment notes, an ink bottle with quill, and a softly glowing crystal orb symbolizing shared information.
Behind the table, a freestanding bulletin pole holds a trio of anonymous message ribbons and sealed envelopes fluttering gently; keep designs neutral to avoid faction or city markings.
A subtle halo of sound waves—delicate concentric arcs in translucent pearl—radiates upward from the crystal orb, implying whispered rumors without creating a backdrop.
Scatter a few conversational tokens on the table such as a brass pocket watch and neutral wax seal stamp to reinforce the theme of gathering clues.

**Color Palette**
Furniture & Wood: Honey maple to warm chestnut gradient (#c18b56 → #875232) with soft charcoal shadows (#424242) and pearl edge glints (#f5f5f5).
Paper & Fabric: Parchment creams and warm ivories (#f5e6c5, #e8d7aa) with muted sepia ink strokes (#4a3a24); chair cushions in subdued mulberry (#7b4a63) and forest green (#3f6b4f).
Metal & Accents: Brass details on pocket watch, seal stamp, and chair studs (#d4a552 → #9c6b2f) with restrained gold highlights (#ffcc66).
Magical Glow: Crystal orb and sound-wave arcs in cool moonlit aqua (#8fd3d1) fading to pearl-white (#f5f5f5), ensuring the glow stays soft and non-directional.
Maintain overall palette balanced between warm neutrals and gentle jewel tones to keep the prompt broadly applicable.

**Line & Texture**
Clean, moderately thin outlines in deep charcoal (#2f2f2f).
Subtle wood grain on furniture, light parchment fiber texture on notes and ribbons, and soft upholstery shading on chair cushions.
Use delicate gradients for the magical glow and sound-wave arcs; reserve tiny sparkle highlights for metal accessories and the crystal orb to avoid over-embellishment.
Keep background empty beyond the icon silhouette so it can layer over any interface.
