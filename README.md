# Text RPG

This repository hosts a simple web-based text RPG prototype intended for deployment via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Running

No build steps are required. After publishing the repository with GitHub Pages, visit the generated site or open `index.html` directly in a browser.

## Structure

- `index.html` – entry point for the game UI
- `style.css` – basic styles and themes
- `script.js` – behaviour for the menu and layout controls
- `assets/images/` – image assets
- `assets/data/` – data assets

Additional functionality will be added over time.
