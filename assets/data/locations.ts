    `The City of Wave's Break

Where Salt Meets Stone, and East Meets West

Nestled between the jagged peaks of the coastal mountains and the restless sea, Wave's Break thrives as the crossroads of land and ocean. The treacherous Wetland Pass has long been impassable, leaving the city as the primary artery of trade between the Eastern farmlands and the Western kingdoms.

The city is famed for its fish and sea-goods sent eastward, while caravans bring in grain, wine, and livestock from the fertile plains beyond. Ships from distant southern ports and inland caravans alike make Wave's Break their anchor point, ensuring the city is never quiet, never still.

Its people are diverse: salt-stained sailors, silver-tongued merchants, hammer-armed crafters, scroll-burdened sages, and faith-driven priests. The city thrives on motionâ€”goods, people, and ideas all collide here, leaving behind a place of markets, temples, shrines, and secrets.`
