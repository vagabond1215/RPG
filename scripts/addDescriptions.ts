  const wheatNarrative = `Among all the gifts of the earth, none is held in higher esteem than wheat, the golden grain. Where it is sown, kingdoms flourish; where it fails, hunger and unrest soon follow. To the farmer it is life, to the baker it is craft, and to the common folk it is daily bread. Its humble stalks may seem simple, yet within each ear lies the strength of nations.

Wheat thrives in the open fields and gentle plains, favoring soils that are tilled and tended by man’s hand. It drinks the spring rains and ripens beneath the summer sun, bending in golden waves as though bowing before the wind. In warmer climes it yields swiftly, but in harsher lands it requires patience, nurtured carefully through the turning of the seasons. From the valleys of the south to the northern frontiers, wheat has found a home wherever men have broken the ground with plough and ox.

The stalk of wheat rises tall and slender, its head crowned with rows of kernels wrapped in husk. From these grains comes the flour that feeds both peasant and king. It may be ground coarse for rustic loaves, or sifted fine for the white bread prized upon noble tables. Once harvested, the sheaves are bound, threshed, and winnowed, leaving behind the seed that sustains. Care must be taken, for weeds and blight may rob the crop of strength, and birds are ever eager to steal the ripening ears.

Wheat is the staff of life, without which no village can endure. It is baked into bread, brewed into ale, and stored as grain against the cold of winter. Its surplus fills granaries, ensuring that markets bustle and armies march. Even the rites of the Church are tied to its blessing, for wheat gives the flour from which holy bread is made. In feast or fast, its presence is never far, a silent witness to the bond between earth and mankind.

Though shaped by the hands of men, wheat still plays its part in the greater order. Its straw beds the beasts, its husks feed the fowl, and its stubble shelters hare and mouse in the field. Thus, while wheat serves as man’s chief provision, it also nourishes the creatures of the wild. To some, the rippling of a ripe wheatfield is a sign of providence itself, as though the land bows in thanks for the care it has received.

Thus is wheat, the grain of plenty: humble in form yet mighty in influence, a treasure of the soil upon which the fate of villages, kingdoms, and empires alike may rest.`;
