Farmers graft favored varieties onto hardy rootstock, tending the orchard for five years before the first true harvest. In autumn, the Fruit-Tenders Guild inspects every barrel of cider and collects a tithe, punishing smuggling with confiscation of presses. Local folklore says that burying a wormy apple beneath your doorstep wards off roving spirits, so villagers trade bruised fruit at market despite the guild's complaints. Some elders claim the practice keeps winter famine at bay.",

Merchant caravans purchase the threads at a premium, yet the Harvesters' Consortium restricts sales to licensed factors, punishing unsanctioned trade. Legends whisper that a single stolen bulb carries a decade of misfortune, so poachers work under masks and false names. During lean winters, villages hoard dried strands to spice thin porridge. Some alchemists barter secret cures for a pinch of the spice.",
