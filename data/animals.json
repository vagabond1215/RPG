    "narrative": "In the terrestrial realms, where the forest stretch far and wide, there dwells the Zebu, a other of note. It keeps to a omnivore fare, taking sustenance as the wilds afford. No yoke nor leash has tamed it, for it prospers without the aid of men. It is mild of temper, wandering free of sworn domain, and offers a low hazard to the heedless. Those who seek its tablefare take the meat, ever mindful it must be cooked thoroughly. No craftsman covets its remains, save in times of need. Thus does the Zebu move through legend and living world alike, keeping the balance of nature and stirring wonder in those who behold it."
