Hens fill wicker baskets with eggs that tithe collectors count by the dozen, while roosters rule dunghill thrones and crow warnings at strangers. Winter feed is dear, so culls happen before Yule, and gossip claims poachers earn whipping posts for stealing church birds. Children charm tame hens with crumbs, yet tales tell of witches who borrow a black rooster for midnight rites. Come feast days, a plump capon simmered with herbs marks prosperity."

Guild charters decree which farms may hire them, and millers keep a stable for carts bearing grain and ale casks. A lame beast sells for glue and leather, so villagers bless harness bells against ill luck. Come autumn fairs, breeders parade towering stallions, demanding silver from nobles seeking war mounts. When famine strikes, whispers spread of desperate folk stewing horseflesh, a grim meal that invites clerical censure yet keeps freezing families alive."

Hunters stalk their tracks when meat runs thin, snaring them with rawhide lines and blessing pelts for warmth. The white fur fetches coin in southern fairs, so smugglers lurk on sled trails despite patrols by the jarl’s men. Folktales warn that spirits of starving winters ride in hare shapes to test hospitality; refusing a share curses a household with blight. When spring melts drifts, leverets scatter and disappear, leaving barren hills until the first flurries whisper their return."

On fasting days the brethren net them for stew, selling surplus at market where fishmongers bargain hard. Local law fines those who poach from abbey ponds, yet hungry peasants sneak at night, believing the carp grant luck if swallowed whole. Each spring, swollen rivers flood the ponds and release a breeding run; children gather stranded fry in baskets to restock. Merchants prize cured carp as cheap sustenance for long caravan roads."
