    "narrative": "The Earthworm is a annelid found in terrestrial regions where it prefers farmland habitats. As a detritivore species, it feeds according to the resources available in those areas. The species remains largely undomesticated, thriving without human intervention. It is rarely aggressive and not strongly territorial, presenting a moderate risk to people who draw near. Those who hunt or farm it may consume its meat; cooks typically note that it should be cooked thoroughly. Few byproducts of notable value can be harvested from it beyond basic necessities. Observers value the Earthworm for the role it plays in the local ecology and the insight it offers into the balance between predator and prey."

Those who hunt or farm it may consume its meat; cooks typically note that it should be stewed with herbs. Byproducts such as meat and fur are collected by those seeking materials or trade goods.

The species remains largely undomesticated, thriving without human intervention. It is rarely aggressive and not strongly territorial, presenting a low risk to people who draw near. Those who hunt or farm it may consume its meat; cooks typically note that it should be cooked thoroughly. Few byproducts of notable value can be harvested from it beyond basic necessities. Observers value the Wood pigeon for the role it plays in the local ecology and the insight it offers into the balance between predator and prey."
