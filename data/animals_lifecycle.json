Yet a law forbids slaughtering laying hens before Midsummer, ensuring steady trade but drawing poachers who try to snatch prized champions for cockfights. Folklore claims their crowing wards off marsh spirits, so villagers place woven charms in each coop."

Old legends warn that disrespecting such beasts invites wagon wheels to splinter at crossroads."
