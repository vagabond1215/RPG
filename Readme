# Text RPG

Initial project setup for a text-based RPG. Directories are prepared for assets and game data so they can be expanded over time.

## Directory Layout
- `assets/images/` – placeholder for game images
- `data/` – placeholder for data files such as characters, items, etc.

## Character
`rpg/character.py` defines a basic `Character` class with attributes like `hp`, `mp`, `stamina`, regen values, `level`, and core stats (`str`, `dex`, `agi`, `con`, `int`, `wis`, `cha`, `luk`).

It also declares equipment slots including `main hand`, `off hand`, `head`, `left ear`, `right ear`, `neck`, `body`, `hands`, `waist`, `legs`, `feet`, and `back`.

## Web Interface
`rpg/web.py` exposes a minimal Flask-based interface for creating characters through the browser.

Run it with:

```
python -m rpg.web
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` to view or add characters.
